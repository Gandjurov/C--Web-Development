                <h2>History of beer</h2>
                <p>
                    Beer is one of the oldest drinks humans have produced, dating back to at least the 5th millennium BC in Iran,
                    and was recorded in the written history of ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia and spread throughout the world.
                    As almost any cereal containing certain sugars can undergo spontaneous fermentation due to wild yeasts in the air,
                    it is possible that beer-like drinks were independently developed throughout the world soon after a tribe or culture had domesticated cereal.
                    Chemical tests of ancient pottery jars reveal that beer was produced as far back as about 7,000 years ago in what is today Iran.
                    This discovery reveals one of the earliest known uses of fermentation and is the earliest evidence of brewing to date.
                    In Mesopotamia, the oldest evidence of beer is believed to be a 6,000-year-old Sumerian tablet depicting people consuming a drink through reed straws from a communal bowl.
                    A 3,900-year-old Sumerian poem honouring Ninkasi, the patron goddess of brewing, contains the oldest surviving beer recipe,
                    describing the production of beer from barley via bread.
                    In China, residue on pottery dating from around 5,000 years ago shows beer was brewed using barley and other grains.
                    <br />
                    The invention of bread and beer has been argued to be responsible for humanity's ability to develop technology and build civilization.
                    The earliest chemically confirmed barley beer to date was discovered at Godin Tepe in the central Zagros Mountains of Iran, where fragments of a jug,
                    from between 5,400 and 5,000 years ago was found to be coated with beerstone, a by-product of the brewing process.
                    <br />
                    Beer may have been known in Neolithic Europe as far back as 5,000 years ago, and was mainly brewed on a domestic scale.
