In the basic course of web programming, we will introduce you to basic <strong>web development principles</strong> such as <strong>HTTP protocol</strong>, <strong>sessions</strong> and ways of preserving the <strong>status</strong>, <strong>caching</strong> of data, various data transfer <strong>protocols</strong>, security.<br/>
We create our own <strong>MVC framework</strong> based on <strong>C#</strong> and <strong>MS SQL Server</strong>, splitting models, views and controllers, with front-controller and router, supporting all the basic functionalities needed for a modern web application: data visualization, tables, CRUD data operations, forms, paging, validation, notifications, users, sessions, login / logout, and more. In practice, you will learn to create your own C# and SQL Server web applications and understand how web applications work as a structure and how <strong>MVC (model-view-controller) technology</strong> works in modern web applications.
